## Evolution of the IoT Devices 



IOT is a trend in the present world to communicate between machines to machine. This helps the business world to make and competitive edge by using this as a solution maker on the consumer market. Collection of data has been futurized by the help of social media platforms, big data and cloud computing making the main objective of data gathering easier impacting the IOT. (Luigi Atzori, 2016) IOT has many definitions, although the best way to explain it is an infrastructure to transport, store, process and give access to the information created to various users or systems. (Dorsemaine, 2017).
The Internet of things concept was introduced in 1999 by one of the members who worked on developing the RFID technology. But recently the use of internet of things is increased and the IoT devices are being evolved rapidly and being engaged in industry and 
The world of the internet of things can be known as making proper decisions, management, planning and initiating actions using the data which were collected regularly using the interconnected objects. In simple words IOT can be describe as the network of physical objects. The internet is not only stopped from computers, but it has been spread out into all the devices such as phones, medical instruments, vehicles, home appliances and even humans. 
IOT can be divided into three parts. 
1.	People to people
2.	People to machines
3.	Machine to machine
The vision of the Internet of Things is to create a smart world. It means to create the cities, energy and transport more intelligent and, the IoT concept has become the new revolution of the Internet.  
The concept of internet of things is based on interconnecting electronical devices together through internet to control them effectively and efficiently.  Electronic devices can be any thing like washing matching, microwave, toaster, light bulb to smart watchers, smart phones and other day to day electronic device. IoT is defined as electronics that has ability to communicate over a network without human to compute or human to human interaction and equipped with a unique identifiers code.
These IoT devices work as an eco system which means several devices are interconnected to complete tasks. These devices also consist with embedded systems to collect data and transfer them to the cloud-based system or edge device system for analyzation and processing. They also use the help or matching learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to complete its processors and tasks.

 When discussing about the importance of IoT, the main points can be identified as the support these IoT device provide to work smatter, quicker and easier. Not only in home environments, but also in business environment IoT can play a major roll. It can give a Realtime coverage over the business and performance of the machines. Also, the task automation and process automation help to speed up the work. Customer experience improvements, productivity enhancements, time and resources saving are also some greater benefits of IoT in the business environment.   

Any technology has its plus points also some drawbacks. Accessibility of the information any where any time, task automation, seamless data transfer through the connected network, easy communication between devices are some major advantages of IoT. When looking at the disadvantages, because of interconnected devices run information between each other a hacker can attack one device to access all the data, as the numbers grow handling the data of lots of Iot devices can be a major issue, a small bug can affect the whole system and can lead to corrupted devices and vendor mismatch is also a major issue as currently there are no universal standards regarding IoT interconnection. 

There are several uprising standards and frameworks in IoT-
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) has introduces ZigBee, an low powered and low data rate network with the name of 802.15.4 slandered. Dotdot is a language created for IoT with the alliance with ZinBee.
Internet Engineering Task Force has introduced (6LoWPAN) IPV6 low power wireless personal area network as an open standard. This used Z Wave and Bluetooth low powered energy for communication 
Object management Group (OMG) has developed (DDS) Data distribution service for high performance, scalable, real time communication.
AWS IoT is a framework implemented by Amazon and it is designed to easily and securely connect IoT devices and services.
ARM MBed IoT is developed by arm technologies and uses arm base microcontrollers. It provide easy scalability and connectivity for IoT devices
Microsoft Azure IoT is another framework handled by Microsoft that provide special services targeted in IoT devices
Googleâ€™s Brillo, which is developed by google has 2 parts that has android based OS and a special Communication protocol
